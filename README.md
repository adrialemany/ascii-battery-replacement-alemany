# GNOME Shell System Stats Extension

## What it does

Hide the original system stats indicator from above right on your screen and adds a new one with ASCII characters which changes colors depending on your remaining battery (if using a laptop)

## Requirements

To activate this extension, you must have the **Extension** and **Extension Manager** apps installed on your Linux system. You can find them in the Software app.

## Installation

2. Copy it into your local GNOME Shell extensions directory:

   ```bash
   ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
   ```

3. Open the **Extensions** app and activate the extension.

## Compatibility

✅ Tested on a **laptop** with **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**.  
⚠️ Compatibility with other distributions, versions or devices is not guaranteed (with a PC it should just remove the battery indicator).
